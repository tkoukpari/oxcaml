(** Rewrite ELF sections for the dissector.

    This module rewrites a partially-linked object file to add IGOT and IPLT
    sections, their associated relocation sections, and rewrites the .rela.text
    section to redirect PLT32 and GOTPCRELX relocations through the IGOT/IPLT.

    For Large_code partitions, sections are also renamed with a prefix
    (e.g., .text -> .caml.p1.text) so the linker script can place them at
    higher addresses.

    The transformation adds:

    - .data.igot section with R_X86_64_64 relocations to original symbols

    - .text.iplt section with R_X86_64_PC32 relocations to IGOT entries

    - Synthetic symbols for each IGOT and IPLT entry

    - Modified .rela.text entries pointing to IPLT/IGOT symbols instead of
      original external symbols *)

(** [rewrite unix ~input_file ~output_file ~partition_kind ~igot_and_iplt
    ~relocations] reads the ELF object file at [input_file], adds IGOT and
    IPLT sections, rewrites relocations, and writes the result to
    [output_file].

    For [Large_code] partitions, section names are also prefixed (e.g.,
    .text -> .caml.p1.text). [Main] partition sections keep their original
    names.
