(** Partitioning object files into size-limited buckets.

    This module partitions a list of files with their sizes into buckets, where
    each bucket's total size is at most a configurable threshold. *)

(** Errors that can occur during file partitioning. *)
type error =
  | File_exceeds_partition_size of
      { filename : string;
        size : int64;
        threshold : int64
      }

(** Exception wrapper for partitioning errors. *)
exception Error of error

(** Pretty-print a partitioning error. *)
val report_error : Format.formatter -> error -> unit

(** Default partition size threshold in bytes (1 GiB). *)
val default_partition_size : int64

(** Convert gigabytes to bytes. *)
val bytes_of_gb : float -> int64

(** [partition_files ~threshold file_sizes] partitions files into buckets,
    starting a new bucket when adding the next file would exceed [threshold].
    The order of files is preserved.

    The input should only contain files destined for partitioning (OCaml files,
    startup object, cached genfns). Passthrough files (C stubs, runtime libs)
    should be handled separately by the caller.

    Raises [Error (File_exceeds_partition_size _)] if any single file exceeds
    the threshold. *)

  threshold:int64 -> Measure_object_files.File_size.t list -> Partition.t list
