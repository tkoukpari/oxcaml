(** Measuring allocated section sizes in object files.

    This module computes the total size of allocated ELF sections across
    a collection of object files, archives, and OCaml compilation units. *)

(** Errors that can occur when measuring object files. *)
type error =
  | File_not_found of string
  | Duplicate_file of string

(** Exception wrapper for measurement errors. *)
exception Error of error

(** Pretty-print a measurement error. *)
val report_error : Format.formatter -> error -> unit

(** The origin of a file, used to determine partition placement.

    Note: Passthrough files (C stubs from -cclib, runtime libraries) are
    separated before measuring and don't use this type. *)
type file_origin =
  | OCaml  (** OCaml-compiled code (.o from .cmx, .a from .cmxa) *)
  | Startup  (** Startup object file *)
  | Cached_genfns  (** Cached generic functions *)

(** Information about a single file's allocated section size. *)
module File_size : sig
  type t

  (** Returns the filename. *)
  val filename : t -> string

  (** Returns the total size of allocated sections in the file. *)
  val size : t -> int64

  (** Returns whether the file contains a .probes section. *)
  val has_probes : t -> bool

  (** Returns the origin of the file. *)
  val origin : t -> file_origin
end

(** [measure_files unix ~files] computes the allocated section size for each
    file in [files].

    Handles the following file types based on extension:
    - .o: ELF object file, analyzed directly
    - .a: archive file, all .o members analyzed and summed

    Files are tracked to avoid double-counting when the same file appears
    multiple times. Returns an empty entry for files with unrecognized
    extensions.

    Each file is paired with its origin, which determines partition
    placement. *)
