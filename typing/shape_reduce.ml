  (* A type of normal forms for strong call-by-need evaluation.
     The normal form of an abstraction
       Abs(x, t)
     is a closure
       NAbs(env, x, t, dnf)
     when [env] is the local environment, and [dnf] is a delayed
     normal form of [t].

     A "delayed normal form" is morally equivalent to (nf Lazy.t), but
     we use a different representation that is compatible with
     memoization (lazy values are not hashable/comparable by default
     comparison functions): we represent a delayed normal form as
     just a not-yet-computed pair [local_env * t] of a term in a
     local environment -- we could also see this as a term under
     an explicit substitution. This delayed thunked is "forced"
     by calling the normalization function as usual, but duplicate
     computations are precisely avoided by memoization.

  (* When reducing in the body of an abstraction [Abs(x, body)], we
     bind [x] to [None] in the environment. [Some v] is used for
     actual substitutions, for example in [App(Abs(x, body), t)], when
     [v] is a thunk that will evaluate to the normal form of [t]. *)

  (* Memoization is absolutely essential for performance on this
     problem, because the normal forms we build can in some real-world
     cases contain an exponential amount of redundancy. Memoization
     can avoid the repeated evaluation of identical subterms,
     providing a large speedup, but even more importantly it
     implicitly shares the memory of the repeated results, providing
     much smaller normal forms (that blow up again if printed back
     as trees). A functor-heavy file from Irmin has its shape normal
     form decrease from 100Mio to 2.5Mio when memoization is enabled.

     Note: the local environment is part of the memoization key, while
     it is defined using a type Ident.Map.t of non-canonical balanced
     trees: two maps could have exactly the same items, but be
     balanced differently and therefore hash differently, reducing
     the effectivenss of memoization.
     This could in theory happen, say, with the two programs
       (fun x -> fun y -> ...)
     and
       (fun y -> fun x -> ...)
     having "the same" local environments, with additions done in
     a different order, giving non-structurally-equal trees. Should we
     define our own hash functions to provide robust hashing on
     environments?

     We believe that the answer is "no": this problem does not occur
     in practice. We can assume that identifiers are unique on valid
     typedtree fragments (identifier "stamps" distinguish
     binding positions); in particular the two program fragments above
     in fact bind *distinct* identifiers x (with different stamps) and
     different identifiers y, so the environments are distinct. If two
     environments are structurally the same, they must correspond to
     the evaluation environments of two sub-terms that are under
     exactly the same scope of binders. So the two environments were
     obtained by the same term traversal, adding binders in the same
     order, giving the same balanced trees: the environments have the
     same hash.
