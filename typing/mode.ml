  (* Notes on flipping

     Our lattices are split into two opposite fragments: monadic and comonadic.
     Moreover:
     - Morphisms between lattices in the same fragment are always monotone.
     - Morphisms between lattices from opposite fragments are always antitone.

     [Solver_mono] only supports monotone morphisms. Due to this limitation,
     here, we flip all lattices in the monadic fragment, which makes morphisms
     between opposite fragments monotone. We submit this category of lattices
     (original comonadic lattices + flipped monadic lattices) to [Solver_mono].

     The resulted interface given by [Solver_mono] therefore has the monadic
     lattices flipped. We build on top of that and provide an interface to the
     downstream code where monadic lattices are flipped back to its original
     ordering. See [module Monadic_gen] and [module Monadic].

module Modality = struct
  (* Inferred modalities

      Similar to constant modalities, an inferred modality maps the mode of a
      record/structure to the mode of a value therein. An inferred modality [f]
      is inferred from the structure/record mode [mm] and the value mode [m]. It
      will only be applied on some [x >= mm]: That is, it will only be applied
      on the original module.

      It should satisfy the following conditions:

      Zapping: [f] should be of the form [join_c] for monadic axes, or [meet_c]
      for comonadic axes.

      Soundness: You should not get a value from a record/structure at a mode
      strictly stronger than how it was put in. That is, for any [x >= mm], [f x
      >= m].

      Completeness: Ideally we also want [f mm <= m].

      Monadic axes

      Soundness condition says [join_c x >= m] for any [x >= mm]. Equivalently,
      [join_c mm >= m]. By adjunction, [c >= subtract_mm m]. We take the lower
      bound [c := subtract_mm m]. Note that this is equivalent to taking [c := m
      >= subtract_mm m]. Proof:

      - [join_m x >= join_(subtract_mm m) x] is trivial since [m >= subtract_mm
        m].
      - [join_m x <= join_(subtract_mm m) x], or equivalently [m <=
      join_(subtract_mm m) x], or equivalently [subtract_x m <= subtract_mm m],
      which is trivial since [x >= mm].

      Taking [c := subtract_mm m] is better for zapping since it's lower and
      thus closer to identity modality. Taking [c := m] is easier for [apply]
      and [sub].

      Comonadic axes

      Soundness condition says [meet_c x >= m] for any [x >= mm]. Equivalently,
      [meet_c mm >= m]. By def. of [meet], we have both [c >= m] and [mm >= m].
      The latter is guaranteed by the user of [infer]. We guarantee the former
      by taking [c := imply_mm m >= m]. One might worry that this is too relaxed
      and will be "less complete" than taking [c := m]; however, note that
      [imply_mm m <= imply_mm m] and thus by adjunction [meet_(imply_mm m) mm <=
      m], which means the chosen [c] is complete.

      Taking [c := m] is easier for [apply] and [sub]. Taking [c := imply_mm m]
      is better for zapping since it's higher and thus closer to identity
      modality. However, note that we DON'T have [meet_m x = meet_(imply_mm m)
      x], which means [apply/sub] and [zap] might behave in a confusing (albeit
      sound) manner.

      CR zqian: once we support binary mode solver, [c := imply_mm m] will be
      used uniformly by [apply] [sub] and [zap].

module Crossing = struct
  (* The mode crossing capability of a type [t] is characterized by a monotone
     function [f] from modes to some lattice [L], in the following way:

     To check [e : t @ m0 <= m1], we should instead check [f m0 <= f m1] to
     allow more programs.

     For example, if [f] is the identity function, then [t] does not cross modes
     at all. If [f] maps to the unit lattice (containing only one element), [f
     m0 <= f m1] always succeeds, which means [t] crosses modes fully.

     In practice, during mode checking we usually have either [m0] or [m1], but
     not both. In order to perform mode crossing one-sided, we require [f] to
     have left adjoint [fl] and right adjoint [fr], which gives:

     [f m0 <= f m1] is equivalent to [fl (f m0) <= m1] is equivalent to [m0 <=
     fr (f m1)]

     Therefore, we can perform any of the following for mode crossing:
     - Apply [f] on both [m0] and [m1]
     - Apply [fl ∘ f] on [m0]
     - Apply [fr ∘ f] on [m1]

     Mode crossing forms a lattice: [f0 <= f1] iff [f0] allows more mode
     crossing than [f1]. Concretely:

     [f0 <= f1] iff, for any [m0, m1], if [f1 m0 <= f1 m1],
     then [f0 m0 <= f0 m1].

         join_c0 b](E1)

         Case analysis by the relation between [c0] and [c1]:
         - If [c0 >= c1], then [c0] can be written as [join c1 k] for some [k].
           Then apply [join k] to E0 and we get E1 (by monotonicity of join).
         - If [c0 <= c1], take [a := c1] and [b := c0]. E0 holds but E1 doesn't.
         - If neither, then we take [a := c1] and [b := meet a c0]. E0 is
           satisfied:
           [join_c1 a = c1 <= c1 = join_c1 (meet a c0) = join_c1 b]. But E1 is
           not satisfied:
           [join_c0 a = join c0 c1 </= c0 = join_c0 (meet c0 c1) = join_c0 b]

  (* Our mode crossing is for [Value] modes, but can be extended to [Alloc]
     modes via [alloc_as_value], defined as follows:

     Given a mode crossing [f] for [Value], and we are to check [Alloc] submoding
     [m0 <= m1], we will instead check
     [f (alloc_as_value m0) <= f (alloc_as_value m1)].

     By adjunction tricks, this is equivalent to
     - [ m0 <= regional_to_global ∘ fr ∘ f ∘ alloc_as_value m1 ]
     - [ regional_to_local ∘ fl ∘ f ∘ alloc_as_value m0 <= m1 ]
     where [regional_to_global] is the right adjoint of [alloc_as_value], and
     [regional_to_local] the left adjoint. *)
