(** Complex shape types.

    Complex shapes represent type layouts that may include unboxed products and
    void types, in addition to "simple" runtime shapes that fit in a single
    register. The term "complex" follows Flambda 2's naming convention (see
    [Flambda_arity.Component_for_creation] in middle_end/flambda2/kinds), where
    "complex" arities can contain unboxed products, as opposed to "singleton"
    arities that describe single-register values.

    A complex shape can be:
    - [Runtime rs]: A runtime shape that has a concrete runtime representation
    - [Void]: A value with no runtime representation
    - [Unboxed_product]: A composite structure containing multiple components,
      each of which is itself a complex shape

    Complex shapes are used during DWARF type generation to accurately describe
    OxCaml types with unboxed layouts before they are flattened into sequences
    of runtime shapes. *)
